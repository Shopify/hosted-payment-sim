Shopify Offsite Gateway Simulator
===========================

This is a common API that simplifies the onboarding of new payment providers, specifically Offsite Gateways / Hosted Payment Pages, that are looking to be used on [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com). By supporting a common API for redirect, cancel, complete, and callback phases of a payment flow, we are giving gateway implementers a way to integrate with Shopify at any time, without requiring a large amount of customization or validation work or bottlenecks by the Shopify integration team.

### Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get started.

1. Review the rest of this document
2. Sign up for a free trial of Shopify at http://www.shopify.com/. You will use this shop to place test orders against your offsite gateway.
3. Send the name of this shop to payment-integrations@shopify.com and mention **Universal Offsite Dev Kit** in the subject

Once we enable developer mode, which normally happens the same day, you'll be ready to proceed with integration testing.

1. [Sign in](http://www.shopify.com/login) to your Shopify store.
2. Go to [Products](http://www.shopify.com/admin/products) and [add a dummy product](http://docs.shopify.com/manual/your-store/products/create-product).
2. Go to [Settings/Checkout](http://www.shopify.com/admin/settings/payments), and select the **Universal Offsite Dev Kit** in the gateway dropdown.
3. Complete the 3 fields,
  + ``x_account_id`` - this is an identifier for a test merchant on your system
  + ``HMAC key`` - this is a key your gateway will use to verify requests and sign responses
  + ``POST URL`` - this is URL on your system that will properly handle [Request Values](#request-values) and is then able to provide proper [Response Values](#response-values) to various return URLs at Shopify
4. Now you're ready to test! From your admin, click the 'view your website' link, and add a product to your cart. On the cart page, click the "Check out" button, enter in some dummy info, and complete the checkout using your gateway.

> We are providing this simple implementation of an Offsite Gateway Sim as a way to demonstrate basics of this new API. If you want to see it in action, leave ``POST URL`` on your **Universal Offsite Dev Kit** empty, or set it to ``https://offsite-gateway-sim.herokuapp.com/``, then try placing another order in your test shop.

As soon as you are confident that your implementation is complete, we'll need to collect some more information about your gateway,

  + Labels for any fields that your gateway will require shops to input when setting it up within Shopify.
    + Your gateway name
    + Label for the ``x_account_id`` field, needs to match your existing terminology, e.g. ``Merchant ID`` or ``Account #``
    + Label for the ``HMAC key`` field, needs to match your existing terminology, e.g. ``Key`` or ``Shared Secret``
  + URL of a POST handler for [Request Values](#request-values) that presents a payment flow to the customer, likely the same one you used to configure *Universal Offsite Dev Kit* gateway during integration testing
  + Your gateway's home page URL
  + Image to display to customers during checkout process that identifies your gateway and/or supported payment options (PNG, height: 20px, max width: 350px)
  + Finally, please indicate whether or not your gateway supports ``x_test`` mode

### Payment Flow

+ Customer initiates checkout on the Shopify storefront
+ Browser is redirected to gateway's URL using a POST request along with [Request Values](#request-values) (mandatory + whatever else may be available)
+ Gateway verifies ``x_signature`` value and presents their own payment flow to the customer (see [Signing Mechanism](#signing-mechanism))
+ Customers who exit the payment flow before successfully completing it should be redirected back to ``x_url_cancel``
+ Customers who complete the payment flow should be redirected back to ``x_url_complete`` with all required [Response Values](#response-values) as query parameters, including ``x_signature`` (see [Signing Mechanism](#signing-mechanism))
+ We strongly recommend that gateway also POSTs a callback asynchronously to ``x_url_callback`` with the same [Response Values](#response-values). This ensures that order can be completed even in cases where customer's connection to Shopify is terminated prematurely
 + HTTP 200 indicates successful receipt of a callback by Shopify. Otherwise up to 5 retries with an interval of at least 60 seconds are recommended
 + Duplicate notifications for the same ``x_reference`` are ignored by Shopify

### Signing Mechanism

All requests and responses must be signed/verified using ``HMAC-SHA256`` ([HMAC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code)) where,

+ ``key`` is a value known to both Shopify (``HMAC key`` field in gateway settings) and the gateway itself
+ ``message`` is a string of all key-value pairs that start with ``x_`` prefix, sorted alphabetically, and concatenated without any separators
  + Resulting codes must be hex-encoded and passed as value of ``x_signature``
  + Make sure to use case-insensitive comparison when verifying provided ``x_signature`` values
  + A key-value pair shouldn't be included in the ``message`` string when it's value is empty

For example,

```ruby
fields = {x_account_id: 123, x_currency: 'USD'}
=> {:x_account_id=>123, :x_currency=>"USD"}
fields.delete_if {|k,v| v.nil? }
message = fields.sort.join
=> "x_account_id123x_currencyUSD"
OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest(OpenSSL::Digest.new('sha256'), 'secret key', message)
=> "06ef4be2654e089b4aa346f970a71988fa3a1452acaa6273573f9db0c32ea355"

"x_signature=06ef4be2654e089b4aa346f970a71988fa3a1452acaa6273573f9db0c32ea355"
```
